    <h2>Hi there stranger! welcome to my first Moringa school brainchild</h2>
    <h3>It's a first so don't judge</h3>

    <p>Okay so a little about me, i'm a 6'4 introvert that lives for absolute serenity but when i'm either gaming online or on the football pitch is when i get chaotic, too chaotic for even the most extreme of extroverts. Other stuff i'm into are <em>anime, reading, fitness, movies and just spending time with family</em>. So however much i've always been into tech for my entire life i never thought of pursuing a carreer in anything tech-oriented. I pursued law and never looked back on my decision but that is uptil i started working on my 3rd year. Worked for months, with that attitude of "just push through 8-5, you need that money" but i was mentally bothered for a while before i got the push i needed from a dear friend in data science that saw i had more interest in what he's ever upto rather than my career direction. Now here i am a 3rd year lawschool dropout enjoying every minute of this tedious datacamp because its something i've ever longed for. Sorry for the lengthy story, i got deeply engaged whilst writing it out. If you wanna know more about me go <a href="Faves.html">here</a> for a deeper breakdown of my fave stuff in life</p>
